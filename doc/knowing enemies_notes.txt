1. what's the problem?
Malware find its way through advertising campaign.

As online advertising reaches a large user population today, attackers have
started exploiting ad networks, including DoubleClick and Zedo, to launch attacks in
different ways. For example, drive-by downloads, scams, and phishing typically
exploit malicious advertisers or ad networks to reach victims, whereas
click frauds often go through malicious or compromised publishers.

2. why should we care?
Our study reveals the rampancy of malvertising: hundreds of top ranking
Web sites fell victims and leading ad networks such as DoubleClick were infiltrated.

3. what's the key idea to solve this problem?
Visit all top 90,000 alexa websites and record network requests, responses, browser events, and the code retrieved.
Identify malicious URLs and paths. Explore features and design a detection algorithm.

For each segment, we annotate every node with a set of attributes, including node popularity,
the role in ad delivery, the do- main registration information, and URL properties

4. how can we believe their solution?
Their solution is based on known malicious nodes. If the website is not known, they may not catch.

5. anything surprising?
21,944,174 unique URLs
286 infected pages
Ratio not high

6. what can we get from their approach?
a. They focus on Focus on display ads, but we want to click ad and visit landing url.
b. Virtual machines + different IP solution is useful for us.
c. The way to label data is useful.
d. They use Firefox. Clear cookies after visit a website. We should care about cookies in our experiment as well.
