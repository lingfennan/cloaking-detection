Design cloaking feature/factor combinations to figure out logic employed by cloakers / workflow of cloaking.
Use the workflow of cloaking to improve the crawler efficiency.
1. cloaking feature / factors include: cookie, referer, user agent, IP, repeat cloaking.
2. experiments should be designed to figure out which of the above factors are functioning and the order of checking on them.

Baseline:
safari + search + click = x
googlebot + visit = o

user agent first?
safari + cookie + visit = x
googlebot + cookie + visit = NA

referer?
safari + search + click = x
safari + visit = o
safari + referer + visit = o

cookie?
safari + search + click = x, safari + visit = x, safari + clear cookie + visit = o
safari + visit = o, safari + search + visit = o
safari + cookie + visit = x

IP?
safari + non-google + search + click = x
safari + google + search + click = o

repeat cloaking?
safari + search + click = x
safari + search + click = o
