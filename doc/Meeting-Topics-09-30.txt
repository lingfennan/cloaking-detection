Progress ==========================================================================
1. hot word list, advertisement list
	hot words crawling from Google Trend (6254 words)
		# more words
	advertisement list crawling from Google Search (2795 advertisements)
		# volume of ads, too small -> no need for automation or too big -> no need for 
		# research volume of ads
	advertisement visiting with selenium
		# referer string, not needed. Or we can argue that

2. Decription of work: Modeling Webpage Dynamics using Simhash, for Cloaking Detection


Questions to answer ==========================================================================
1. Motivation
35% advertisement violations. Non-public Google data. How can we justify the motivation?

2. Minhash (random sampling) vs. Simhash (dimension reduction)
Which one is better for cloaking detection (capturing both differences and similarities)?

3. What would be the user's incentives to install the extension to collect simhash from them? Enforce by Google?

4. User privacy? formal proof? 
If size(feature set) > epsilon, then collision probability = 1

5. Same URL (website) definition?


Next Steps ========================================================================
1. Planet Lab Experiment

2. Google IP vs. User IP, hot word list

3. Evaluations

4. In real world, how many differences result in complete different simhash?

5. Model Learning Algorithm
