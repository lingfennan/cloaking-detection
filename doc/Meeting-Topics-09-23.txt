Progress
1. selenium browser automation
	hot words crawling from Google Trend (6254)
	advertisement list crawling from Google Search (2795)
	advertisement visiting with selenium 
2. simhash-py
	hash algorithm, hash key, clustering algorithms


Questions to answer
1. Robustness
a. Timing: When are we going to grab the content and compute simhash?
The page could deliver bad content after a while, which simply bypasses our detection.
b. Structure vs. Text: 

2. Privacy and Attack Model
Proof?

3. Properties of simhash. Is it distributive? commutative? 
what simhash essentially captures? Show several (very) simple cases and compute/compare actual simhash results on them. This has to be (almost always) done when you are introducing/using some distance measures to the new problem.



Next Steps
1. Get advisor or labmates involved?
2. Set up regular meetings
3. Target Oakland or USENIX
