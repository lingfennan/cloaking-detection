1. what's the problem?
syntactic cloaking is all the cloaking. semantic cloaking is a subset of syntactic cloaking.
detect semantic cloaking, which aims at gaming the search engine.

2. why should we care?
search engine should rank the relevant pages at the top, however, semantic cloaking is gaming
search engine, failing its purpose.

3. what's the key idea to solve this problem?
two step. first filter the pages that are potentially doing cloaking (huristics are used, a dictionary is proposed,
but they actually use 3-term difference in evaluation), then use classifier to detect semantic cloaking in
the filtered result.

4. how can we believe their solution?
they can detect user agent cloaking.
they cannot detect IP cloaking.
they cannot detect cookie/referer based cloaking (bad content is shown only when user visit the website
through search engine.

5. anything surprising?
more than 1% semantic cloaking. in our case, are we supposed to see more in advertisements?

6. what can we get from their approach?
Open Directory Project -- what is this?
The URL sets to test. In our next project (current one aims at advertisement cloaking)), which aims at search engine
cloaking detection, we could employ this dataset.
