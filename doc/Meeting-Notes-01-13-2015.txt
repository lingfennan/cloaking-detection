Progress ==========================================================================

1. Search and click implemented as follows:

User Data Collection
Compile a list of cloaking oriented words from banned items according to adwords
policy
--> For each word, grab top 200 Google search results and corresponding ads
--> Use search results to train, test and get a model
--> Use the model to detect ads cloaking

Google Data Collection
In the User Data Collection phase, each Google search results and corresponding
ads have landing urls.
--> For each landing url, use Google bot to visit them multiple times
--> For each url (parameter values discarded), model with simhash distribution

For each observation User Data Collection, detect whether they are doing
cloaking or not.


2. Workflow is like this:
Training phase (search results)
User visit one URL   -----------------> Compare observed simhash with the model
        |                                            ^                   | 
        |                                            |                   | 
        |                                            |                   v
        |                                            |      cloaking or benign
        |                                            |                   | 
        v                                            |     hand labeling |
Google repeatedly visit this URL ----> Model distribution of this URL    |
                                                     ^                   |
                                                     |                   v
                                                     |------------- TPR and FPR
                                                      ajust parameters

Detection phase (advertisements)
User visit one URL   -----------------> Compare observed simhash with the model
        |                                            ^                   | 
        |                                            |                   | 
        |                                            |                   | 
        |                                            |                   | 
        |                                            |                   | 
        v                                            |                   | 
Google repeatedly visit this URL ----> Model distribution of this URL    |
                                                                         v
                                                            cloaking or benign 


Next Steps ==========================================================================

Weiren Wang:
1. Abusive word expansion and collection.
Extend these words according to adwords policy. There are advertisements
forbidden by adwords. Come up with those words from the word policies.

Policies are available at link:
https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/topic/1626336?hl=en&ref_topic=2996750

2. Domain reputation based cloaking filter
Query URLVoid API and WOT api to build a filter. After filtering, we get a list
of URL (domains) that have low reputation.

Prototype implemented at src/utils/{wot.py, urlvoid.py}


Ruian Duan:
1. Abusive word expansion and collection
Co-work on this with Weieren

2. Evaluate the performance of the system
Run the experiment

3. Start writing the paper
The paper writing can start parallelly with experiments
