This project requires collecting users simhash and URL

1. Attacker has the hash.
Because it is one-way hash. The attacker could not tell what is the content.

2. Attacker has URL/Simhash pair. He could visit the URL and compute hash by himself.
Comparing the hash he sees with what user sees,
if the hash is similar, then he knows what user is seeing but he could not know a particular field.
Because of high collision probability.
if the hash varies a lot, then the attacker could not get content from the hash because of 1.
but he could know that the user is seeing something different from him.

3. RAPPOR differential privacy. the user answers the simhash and URL in probability.
Therefore, the attacker could not know who is answering this question. whether he is telling the truth.
