Note: I made a change to the clustering algorithm.

The training data, including user text/dom, google text/dom, expected and noise.

The ROC curve:

Before Feb 18, 3:30 PM, learning depth = 2
training_data_dom_ROC
training_data_text_ROC

After Feb 18, 3:30 PM, learning depth = m - 1, m is the number of obesrvations.
new_learn_training_data_dom_ROC
new_learn_training_data_text_ROC

After Feb 19, 4:00 PM, learning is set to two phase
first learn T_test and T_train
this corresponds to 
train_dom_ROC_coefficient
train_text_ROC_coefficient

second learn R_test
this corresponds to 
train_dom_ROC_radius
train_text_ROC_radius

On Feb 20, we have generated the ROC curve
train_text_plot_ROC
train_dom_plot_ROC
