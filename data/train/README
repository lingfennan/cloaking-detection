Note: I made a change to the clustering algorithm.

The training data, including user text/dom, google text/dom, expected and noise.

The ROC curve:

Before Feb 18, 3:30 PM, learning depth = 2
training_data_dom_ROC
training_data_text_ROC

After Feb 18, 3:30 PM, learning depth = m - 1, m is the number of obesrvations.
new_learn_training_data_dom_ROC
new_learn_training_data_text_ROC
