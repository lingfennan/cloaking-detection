% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

%It's great when this section says that MyWonderfulApp is free software, 
%available via anonymous FTP from
%
%\begin{center}
%{\tt ftp.site.dom/pub/myname/Wonderful}\\
%\end{center}
%
%Also, it's even greater when you can write that information is also

%Now we get serious and fill in those references.  Remember you will
%have to run latex twice on the document in order to resolve those
%cite tags you met earlier.  This is where they get resolved.
%We've preserved some real ones in addition to the template-speak.
%After the bibliography you are DONE.
