% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\section{Acknowledgments}

A polite author always includes acknowledgments.  Thank everyone,
especially those who funded the work. 

\section{Availability}

It's great when this section says that MyWonderfulApp is free software, 
available via anonymous FTP from

\begin{center}
{\tt ftp.site.dom/pub/myname/Wonderful}\\
\end{center}

Also, it's even greater when you can write that information is also 
available on the Wonderful homepage at 

\begin{center}
{\tt http://www.site.dom/\~{}myname/SWIG}
\end{center}

Now we get serious and fill in those references.  Remember you will
have to run latex twice on the document in order to resolve those
cite tags you met earlier.  This is where they get resolved.
We've preserved some real ones in addition to the template-speak.
After the bibliography you are DONE.
