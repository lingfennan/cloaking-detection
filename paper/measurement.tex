\end{table}

With the model built in ~\autoref{s:evaluation}, we detect cloaking in
the four collected datasets, spammy search, $D_{spam, search}$, hot search,
$D_{hot, search}$, spammy ads $D_{spam, ad}$, hot ads, $D_{hot, ad}$. 
$D_{spam, search}$. From our observations, we categorize cloaking websites into 9 types:
pharmacy, gambling, loan, general traffic sale, pay per click, error page, illegal service,
phishing, redirect domain and malware downloading. To better analyze cloaking incentives, 
we divided traffic sale into 4 categories: pharmacy, gambling, loan and general traffic sale. 


In SEO field, we detect cloaking websites in spammy search and hot search field. In spammy search,
we applied our cloaking detection system on 129393 websites. Cloaking detection system reported 2491
cloaking websites. 661 websites are cloaking of pharmacy. 1514 websites are cloaking of gambling.
33 websites are cloaking of loan. 28 websites are cloaking of general traffic sale. 28 websites are cloaking
of pay per click. 43 websites are cloaking of error page. 122 websites are cloaking of illegal service. 
17 websites are cloaking of phishing. 73 websites are cloaking of redirect domain. 20 websites are cloaking of malware downloading.
In hot search, we applied our cloaking detection system on 25533 websites. Cloaking detection system reported 93
cloaking websites. 33 websites are cloaking of pharmacy. 2 websites are cloaking of gambling.
26 websites are cloaking of loan. 27 websites are cloaking of traffic sale. 2 websites are cloaking of cloaking of
error page. 2 websites are cloaking of illegal service. 3 websites are cloaking of redirect domain. 

In SEM field, we deteck cloaking websites in spammy ads and hot ads. In spammy ads,
we applied cloaking detection system on 25533 websites. Cloaking detection system reported 6 cloaking websites.
1 website is cloaking of pay per click. In hot ads, we applied cloaking tection system on 25209 websites.
Cloaking detection system reported 10 cloaking websites. 4 websites are cloaking of traffic sale.
6 websites are cloaking of illegal service. 



\subsection{Cloaking in SEO}

SEO: How severe is cloaking? How many categories and percentages of various
cloaking? For each type of cloaking, what are their incentives?

\XXX{Plot a log scale pie or histogram for categories in SEO}
Out of the 20k distinct urls, we detect 1600 urls. There are mainly composed of
60\% phishing sites, 30\%illegal services, 10\% malicous domain. Phishing sites includes rogue
pharmacy sites. Illegal services include gambling, essay writing. Malicious
domain are verified manually, we manually visit these URLs and are redirected to
malware download.

Compared to  ~\cite{wang2011cloak}, we detected a relatively small percentage of
cloaking, this is probably because search engine is taking active action now, or
the cloaking methods have evolved.

\subsection{Cloaking in SEM}

How severe is cloaking? How many categories and percentages of various cloaking?
For each type of cloaking, what are their incentives?

\XXX{Plot a log scale pie or histogram for categories in SEM}
In SEM, we have detected 100 claoking examples out of 10k ads. This percentage
is lower compared to SEO. However, ads are much more important because they
matters, clicks in ads equals money. Most of the detected cloaking are providing
illegal services.

We argue that, previous methods cannot be used to detect SEM cloaking, simply
because performing clicks from search engine side, is ad fraud. In contrast,
SWM simply collects the fuzzy signatures of websites. With privacy guarantee
provided by RAPPOR~\cite{erlingsson2014rappor}, and one-wayness of simhash,
crowdsourcing is an achievable and elegant way to detect cloaking.

\subsection{Cross Domain Spam Detection}
In our detection result, we have observed many cloaking cases, where URL are
completely different, while the content are similar or even the same.
We argue that, the foundamental reason for them to do this is the low cost of
getting a new URL and lack of efficient way to detect spammy content.
Based on this observation, we propose content based blacklist to raise the bar
for reusing spammy content. This approach leverages the most popular use of
simhash - near duplicate detection. For spammy pages, in order to evade our
detection, they not only need to change URL rapidly, but also update their
content everytime, which can be expensive in their current mode if they want
every copy their website to be different and have meaningful and stay attractive
to user.
