\end{table*}


With the model built in ~\autoref{s:evaluation}, we detect cloaking in
four collected datasets, spammy search, $D_{spam, search}$, hot search,
$D_{hot, search}$, spammy ads $D_{spam, ad}$, hot ads, $D_{hot, ad}$. 
$D_{spam, search}$. From our observations, we categorize cloaking websites into
seven types:
Traffic Sale, Pay-Per-Click (PPC), Error Page, Illegal Service,
Phishing, Parking Domain and Malware Downloading.
To better analyze cloaking incentives, 
we divided traffic sale into four categories: pharmacy, gambling, loan and general traffic sale. 
Traffic sale sites are usually third party url composed of single iframe
pointing the target site for traffic monetization, ~\autoref{seo:cloaking} gives
an example. PPC means user view of landing page simply host pay-per-click advertisements.
Error Page refers to website that deliver simple information, such as character 'P' to user,
but SEO content to Google, the reason is unknown.
Illegal Service includes websites that provide essay writing service, copyrighted
content and bot service, e.g. buy 10k youtube likes.
Parking Domain refers to domains that redirect user to unwanted download, but
not necessarily malicious.

\subsection{Cloaking in SEO}
In SEO, we detect cloaking websites in $D_{spam, search}$ and $D_{hot,
search}$. In $D_{spam, search}$, we applied our cloaking detection system 
on 129393 websites. We manually label
the detection results and identified 2491 cloaking websites which are further
labeled with its incentive ~\autoref{tbl:result}. Majority of these sites fall into traffic sale. 
But it is worth noticing that phishing, parking domain and malware sums to 110
in the table, which need to be cautious about.
In $D_{hot, search}$, cloaking detection system returned 93
cloaking websites. 33 websites are cloaking of pharmacy. 2 websites are cloaking of gambling.
26 websites are cloaking of loan. 27 websites are cloaking of traffic sale. 
2 websites are cloaking of illegal service. 3 websites are cloaking of parking domain.

From the detection result, we see that the main goal of cloaking as an SEO 
technique is to obtain user traffic.
In spammy search, 89.7\% is traffic sale cloaking. 97.27\% of them are from
pharmacy and gambling. 
In hot search, 94.6\% is traffic sale cloaking. 
We conclude that majority of cloaking websites in SEO field is doing traffic
sale, but there are sites promoting illegal service and even phishing and
malware as well.

%For SEO and SEM, the cloaking rate is 5\% and 3\% in the dataset collected by
%us.

%We see a lower cloaking rate compared to XXX, may be because Google has done
%something to this. However, this problem still remains.

\subsection{Cloaking in SEM}

In SEM field, we deteck cloaking websites in $D_{spam, ad}$ and $D_{hot, ad}$. In spammy ads,
we applied cloaking detection system on 25533 websites. Cloaking detection system reported 6 cloaking websites.
1 website is cloaking of pay per click. In hot ads, we applied cloaking tection system on 25209 websites.
Cloaking detection system reported 10 cloaking websites. 4 websites are cloaking of traffic sale.
6 websites are cloaking of illegal service. 

In spammy ads and hot ads, none of cloaking websites are traffic sale cloaking. 
One reason is page ranking mechamisms in SEM.
Because most of ads are ranked by their real time bid price,
there is no incentives to raise page rank by increasing traffic sale.
In addition, using ads to increase traffic sale can cost a lot.
Instead of using ads to increase page rank, a direct way
is to pay search engine like Google to get higher rank. 
Most of cloaking websites in SEM have strong commercial incentives. In spammy Ads,
83.3\% are providing illegal services to gain profits. 
16.7\% are pay per click cloaking website. As long as the pay per click cloaking 
website get enough clicks and gain more money than bidding cost,
it is worthy to do pay per click cloaking in SEM. In hot ads, we see 60\%
cloaking websites are providing illegal service.
This fact confirmed our conclusion that most of cloaking in
SEM are motivated by commercial profits.

%We argue that, previous methods cannot be used to detect SEM cloaking, simply
%because performing clicks from search engine side, is ad fraud. In contrast,
%SWM simply collects the fuzzy signatures of websites. With privacy guarantee
%provided by RAPPOR~\cite{erlingsson2014rappor}, and one-wayness of simhash,
%crowdsourcing is an achievable and elegant way to detect cloaking.

%\subsection{Cross Domain Spam Detection}
%In our detection result, we have observed many cloaking cases, where URL are
%completely different, while the content are similar or even the same.
%We argue that, the foundamental reason for them to do this is the low cost of
%getting a new URL and lack of efficient way to detect spammy content.
%Based on this observation, we propose content based blacklist to raise the bar
%for reusing spammy content. This approach leverages the most popular use of
%simhash - near duplicate detection. For spammy pages, in order to evade our
%detection, they not only need to change URL rapidly, but also update their
%content everytime, which can be expensive in their current mode if they want
%every copy their website to be different and have meaningful and stay attractive
%to user.
